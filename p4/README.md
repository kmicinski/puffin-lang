# Project 5: Functions, Lambdas, and Closures

This is the final language that everyone in the class will
implement. We'll implement a language, R4, which includes functions
`(define (f ...) ...)` and application of user-defined functions `(f
...)`. As an extension, the language R5 will also add *lambdas*, and
closures, via closure conversion covered in [this class YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMtaXO_xHYU). The R5 extension
is extra credit, but the R4 baseline is a seriously impressive
language, with an impressive degree of expressivity.

Still, however, there are some painfully obvious things this language
omits, which represent very trivial extensions I encourage you to
implement on your own (as part of your final project, if you are in
CIS531):

- On the easier end, we don't even have things like multiplication
  `*`, modulo `/`, etc. built into the language. Adding these would be
  trivial but a bit of work.

- Our program can *still* display only a single value: generalizing
  this would require either (a) adding strings (which has its own set
  of runtime choices, if allow ourselves to dynamically allocate
  strings) or (b) adding some primitives like `(print_int ...)` and
  `(print_char ...)`. Adding just these two could allow us to print
  whole lines. To get format strings, the easiest way is to write a
  runtime function in `runtime.c`

- On the more concerning end, we have no real type/memory safety in
  this language, even still--making it a very poor choice for 2025. In
  the last language, typechecking was easy because we didn't have
  functions. For this languag, the obvious "safe" choice is to do
  runtime type tagging and dynamic types, which would be the subject
  of the next mandatory project (if we had time). You could also
  imagine using a typechecker, but it starts to get complicated once
  we mix functions, vectors, etc. unless we are okay doing type
  annotations and skipping polymoprhism, which is a practical
  limitation as we must monomorphize.


## Input Language (R4/5)

All students must implement the language R4, which extends our
language to include top-level (but not nested) `define`s. Compared to
R3 and the previous languages--where our program was a single
expression--our program now consists of a list of functions, followed
by a single "main" expression. When our program is compiled, we handle
this "main" expression a bit differently (we describe more below):

```racket
defn ::= (define (f x ...) e) ;; Fixed-arity top-level definitions
program ::= (program defn* e)
```

As an example of an R4 program...

```scheme
(program 
 (define (fib x)
   (if (eq? x 0)
       1
       (if (eq? x 1)
	   1
	   (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2))))))
 (let ([x (read)])
   (if (< x 8) (fib x) (fib 8))))
```

The major extensions are these:

(1) Definitions: to handle top-level functions, we need to extend all
    passes of the compiler to work on a per-definition basis. This is
    a pervasive change, but the amount of intellectual work is rather
    small: compilation happens on a per-function basis, and so it's as
    simple as ensuring we map a per-function handler across each
    definition (more details about this below).

(2) Function calls: the syntax of expressions is extended to include
    calls to functions. In the simplest case, this is something like
    `(f x)`, but in general the function could be computed like `((f g) x)`.

(3) Lambdas (R5): We support these via closure conversion, on which I
    have a video lecture. The testcases that include lambdas are
    bonus: if you're not attempting the bonus, you can just make this
    pass the identity function.

## Repository Layout

- `compile.rkt` – Your pass implementations. You will edit functions provided here.
  -> This is the *only* file you will edit! The rest are read-only
- `irs.rkt` – IR definitions and predicates like `anf-program?`, `c1-program?`, etc. (see also typed/shrunk variants)
- `interpreters.rkt` – Reference interpreters for several IRs (used by tests and for your own debugging).
- `system.rkt` – System/ABI configuration, pass names, runtime filenames, output paths, etc.
- `main.rkt` – Driver that runs all passes, can build a binary, and can launch a debug server.
- `test.rkt` – Test harness. Runs isolation tests or end-to-end native tests depending on `-m` mode.
- `runtime.c` – Minimal runtime (`read_int64`, `print_int64`, etc.).
- `test-programs/` – Example programs (`.scm`).
- `input-files/` – Input streams for programs (lines of integers).
- `goldens/` – Instructor goldens (IR snapshots, interpreter outputs, and stdout baselines).

Please do not rename files or directories (grading infra depends on them).

## The Compiler Pipeline (passes)

The compiler is designed in passes, which go:

```
 --> R4/R5? -- Source program (R5 is extra credit)                                         <INPUT>
 |
 +-> shrunk-R5? -- Core R4/5 (removes syntactic sugar / extra forms)                       [shrink]
 |
 +-> unique-source-tree? -- Every bound identifier is written exactly once                 [uniqueify]
 |
 +-> revealed-functions-program? -- Makes all calls explicit via fun-ref and app           [reveal-functions]
 |
 +-> assignment-converted-program? -- Eliminates set!; variables become 1-slot vectors     [assignment-convert]
 |
 +-> closure-converted-program? -- Lift lambdas to top-level defines, allocate closures    [lift-lambdas]
 |
 +-> limited-arity-program? -- Rewrites >6-arg functions to pass the rest in a vector      [limit-functions]
 |
 +-> anf-program? -- A-Normal form (flattening nested expressions)                         [anf-convert]
 |
 +-> blocks-program? -- (Formerly C2) blocks of sequences of commands, if, gotos, calls    [explicate-control]
 |
 +-> locals-program? -- Uncovering local variables for each function                       [uncover-locals]
 |
 +-> instr-program? -- Pseudo-x86, flattened blocks of instructions over pseudo-vars       [select-instructions]
 |
 +-> homes-assigned-program? -- Assigns variables to stack locations (rbp-relative homes)  [assign-homes]
 |
 +-> patched-program? -- Patches illegal x86 forms (e.g., mem-mem moves, bad leaq forms)   [patch-instructions]
 |
 +-> x86-64? -- Final x86-64 IR with prologue/epilogue and printing logic                  [prelude-and-conclusion]
 |
 +-> string? -- Rendered as GAS assembly text suitable for writing to a .s file            [dump-x86-64]
```

The following passes are *NEW*: 

- `reveal-functions`, which exposes calls to functions like `(f ...)`,
  differentiating it from built-in functions like `+` by rewriting it
  to `(app (fun-ref f) ...)`.

- `lift-lambdas` -- this is an extra credit (required for PhD
  students) pass which performs closure conversion, enabling us to use
  lambdas anywhere we could otherwise call a function, and even return
  lambdas from other functions.

- `limit-functions` -- this pass limits functions to six arguments,
  which avoids having to look in the callee for the rest of the
  variables. We do this by taking functions with greater than six
  arguments and putting the rest in a vector, which is constructed at
  each callsite and deconstructed upon function entry.

The rest of the passes are *updated* in a _very systematic manner_:
generally speaking, you need to map your previously-single-function
logic across multiple functions.

### `shrink` 

First, shrink needs to support both function calls and (R5 only)
lambdas. Second, this pass expects an input like:

```
(program (define (f x ...) e) ... e-main)
```

I.e., the final item in the list is the *main expression* in the
program. Every program in R4 is a list of definitions (possibly empty)
followed by a final "main" expression. The shrink pass needs to wrap
this in a `main` function:

```
(program (define (f x ...) e) ... (define (main) e-main))
```

### `uniqueify` 

This pass needs to change in two ways: it needs to map the `rename`
function across each definition, taking the variable names into
account. Second, it needs to accomodate function calls (simple: just
map `rename` across each argument / the function expression) and
lambdas: be sure to be mindful that lambdas establish bindings and
thus need to be handled similarly to `let`.

### `reveal-functions`

This is a new pass: the purpose of this pass is to change function
applications like `(f x y z)` into `(app (fun-ref f) x y z)`. The
reason this is important is basically this: we will sometimes want to
compile *user-written* functions in a specific manner (specifically:
tacking on an extra closure parameter, in the case of closure
conversion), and so we need to have some way to look at every function
call site and determine: is this a call to a *user* function, or a
*builtin* function? Also, at runtime, we represent functions using
function pointers, and we look up their values using the load
effective address (`lea`) instruction: we add `(fun-ref ,f)` as a new
kind of atom at this IR level.

This pass is pretty straightforward to write, it has two basic steps: 

- Collect all of the top-level function names into a big set. You can
  do this by pattern matching:

```
  (match p
    [`(program (define (,names ,params ...) ,bodies) ...)
      ;; names is a list of function names
      (define all-names (list->set names))
```

- Walk over every expression (in every body) and rewrite every plain
  variable to `(fun-ref ...)` when it is in this set: re-usages of the
  same name will already have been uniquified, so this is not too hard
  to write as a recursive function.

### `assignment-convert`

- Supporting `app` is easy: we map `a-c` across all the things being applied. 

- Supporting `lambda` is a bit harder, because you need to ensure that
  we box all formal arguments passed into the function. I do this using a helper function

```
  ;; box-formals: helper function (use for defines and lambdas)
  ;; transform (lambda (x y z) ...) => (lambda (x123 y235 z523) (let ([x (vector x12)]) ...)
  ;; genformals and realformals are lists of symbols
  ;; e-body is an expression which will be used when no vars left
  (define (box-formals genformals realformals e-body)
    (match genformals
      ['() e-body]
      [`(,x . ,rst)
       `(let ([,(first realformals) (make-vector 1)])
          (let ([_ (vector-set! ,(first realformals) 0 ,x)])
            ,(box-formals rst (rest realformals) e-body)))]))
```

### `lift-lambdas`

This is the closure conversion pass. The closure conversion pass is
explained fairly thorougly in this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMtaXO_xHYU Additionally, the course
slides give some detailed coverage of the ideas. The basic idea is
this: every function in your program is annotated with an extra `clo`
argument. We will implement flat closures, where a closure is a vector
of (a) a function pointer followed by (b) the closure's free variables
in some canonical order. I recommend implementing bottom-up closure
conversion, you walk over each expression (in each definition, don't
forget that) to emit a set of "lifted" lambdas (top-level `define`s
which accept a `clo` argument along with the rest of the lambda's
arguments) which are then spliced on to the program. Additionally,
lambda lifting ensures that each syntactic lambda in the program is
compiled into an allocation of a vector and then population of it with
the function pointer and free variables (properly allocating /
building the closure).

### `limit-functions`

This pass is relatively small as well, it has a very simple purpose:

- Every function that accepts >6 arguments should be rewritten so that
  its last argument is a vector, and the function's body should be
  rewritten so that the first thing it does is unpack the variables
  via this vector.

- Every function call that uses >6 arguments should be rewritten to
  allocate a vector, populate it, and pass it as the last argument.


### `anf-convert` 

- ANF conversion needs to be extended to support application: `(app
  ,e0 ,e-rest ...)` needs to first convert `e0` to an atom, then
  convert each one of `e-rest` to a list of atoms `e-vs`. Finally, you
  `gensym` a new symbol `x` and return `(let ([,x (app ,a0 ,@a-vs)])
  ,(k x))`. To walk over the expressions, I used a helper function
  that looks like:

```
       (define (handle-rest e-rest as)
         (match e-rest
           ['()
             ;; base case: gensym x and generate an app 
           [`(,hd . ,rest)
            (convert-expr
             hd
             (lambda (a) (handle-rest rest (cons a as))))]))
```

### `explicate-control`

This pass has almost no changes:

- Map over each top-level definition using a `(per-defn ...)`, that
  applies `expr->blocks` to each function body.

- `expr->blocks` simply turns the `(let ([x (app ...)]) ...)` into
  `(assign ,x (app ,a-f ,@a-args))`

### `uncover-locals`

- I gave this pass to you again, it is fairly simply, I have updated
  it in the expected manner.

### `select-instructions` 

- This pass needs to be updated to support `(seq (assign ,lhs (app
  ,a-f ,args ...)) ,next)`. This should:

    - Copy all arguments into registers. Use the list
      `(argument-registers-list)` in `system.rkt`, which gives the
      list of regisers<->arguments in order.
    - Make an `(indirect-callq ...)` to the function atom
    - Move the result register `%rax` into `lhs`

- This pass also needs to be updated to support `fun-ref`, which will
  only over occur in the form `(seq (assign ,x (fun-ref ,f)) ,rest)`:

    - This should be translated to a `leaq` instruction using the `fun-ref` as an argument

- In this pass, we also generate a `conclusion` block. In our last
  project, we just left this empty. In this project, you should set it
  to just `((retq))` (i.e., a list with a single instruction,
  `(retq)`). In the `prelude-and-conclusion` pass we will generate the
  prelude / conclusion.

### `assign-homes`

- This pass needs to be updated to support `leaq` (which will always
  have a fun-ref as its argument) and `indirect-callq`

### `patch-instructions`

- Also needs to be updated to handle `leaq`, which requires its
  destination is a register.

### `prelude-and-conclusion`

This pass needs a bit more work, due to the following reason: in our
previous pass, we used a block name `conclusion`. We rename the block
from `conclusion` to a globally-unique name. Perhaps it is exemplary
of bad design that we need to do it this way: it might be something we
change in future semesters, but for now I did something like this:

- I implemented a function, `rename-conclusion`: 

```
(define (rename-conclusion blocks name)
    (define (h instr)
      (match instr
        [`(jmp ,blk) #:when (equal? blk (conclusion-block-name))
         `(jmp ,name)]
        [i i]))
    (foldl (lambda (k acc) (hash-set acc k (map h (hash-ref blocks k))))
           (hash)
           (hash-keys blocks)))
```

- For each definition, I do one of two things: 

  - If the function is the special function `(entry-symbol)`, then I
    make the conclusion block move the result into `%rdi` and
    `print_int64` it, finally returning from main. In a future
    language, I might consider saying that main doesn't print its
    final value unless the user chooses to do it: but I wanted to be
    maximally consistent with the previous projects, this time.

So, I have code that looks something like this:

```
       (define start-block (hash-ref blocks f))
       (define new-start-block
         `((pushq (reg rbp))
           (movq (reg rsp) (reg rbp))
           (addq (imm ,space-needed) (reg rsp))
           ,@start-block))
       (define conclusion-block
         (if (equal? f (entry-symbol))
             `(;; move result into %rdi and print_int64 it
               (movq (reg rax) (reg rdi))
               (callq print_int64 0)
               ;; 0 return value (to the terminal/system) into %rax
               (movq (imm 0) (reg rax))
               ;; reinstate stored %rbp
               (movq (reg rbp) (reg rsp))
               (popq (reg rbp))
               ;; transfer back to caller
               (retq))
             ;; else, just return...
             `((movq (reg rbp) (reg rsp))
               (popq (reg rbp))
               (retq))))
       (define my-conclusion-block (gensym 'conclusion))
       (define blocks+ ;; build the blocks here...)
	   ;; now, return updated function
       `(define ,locals (,f ,@args) ,blocks+)
```

### `dump-x86-64`

- As all other passes do, this needs to map across all
  definitions. But in this case, all of the blocks in every definition
  are all globally unique, so all we do is run the `render-block`
  function for each block in every function. There is *no* requirement
  that the blocks that get generated sit next to each other in the
  emitted source code (though it may make debugging easier).

- We need to physicaly render two new assembly insructions: `leaq` and
  `indirect-callq`. Both of these are fairly easy, for `leaq` you want to use 
  `(format "leaq ~a(%rip), ~a" (rt-sym f) ...)`.

- Here you need to be especially careful about how you call `rt-sym`:
  in short, everything that is a function name needs to be rendered by
  calling `rt-sym`, because functions on OSX need a `_` prepended. I
  do this in the following manner: in `render-block`, I check if the
  block name I'm spitting out is known to be a function name: if so, I
  call `rt-sym` on it, if not I don't: 

```
    (define txt-label (if (set-member? functions name) (format "~a:\n" (rt-sym name)) (format "~a:\n" name)))
```

- In the `leaq` instruction, I call `rt-sym` as well (as I do in the
  regular `call` instruction for things from `runtime.c`).

## Implementing `define`s and applications

The major innovation of this project is to enable functions at the top
level and (optionally) to perform lambda lifting. The most common
change that our compiler will face is this: in our previous IR, we had
an IR like `(program ,info ,code), where info and code got filled in
throughout the compilation to be increasingly lower-level--but at each
pass, we always matched with this pattern. But now, we can't do that
anymore--we need to generalize every pass. This sounds like a lot of
work, but generally it ends up amounting to changing our code from
something like this:

```
(match p
  [`(program ,info ,e)
   `(program ,info ,(process e))))
```

to something like this:

```
(define (per-defn defn)
  (match-defne defn `(define ,info (,f ,formals ...) ,code))
  `(define ,info (,f ,@formals) ,(process code)))
(match p
  [`(program ,info ,defns ...)
   `(program ,info ,(map per-defn defns))])
```

See what we did? We wrote a per-definition handler, `(per-defn ...)`,
which does the bulk of the processing that we did before--then, we
mapped over that per-definition function for each of the
definitions. This trick is very common is the best way to start
transforming your passes to accomodate definitions.

The `shrink` pass now assumes that the program has the structure
`(program (define (f ...) ...) ... e)`, and transforms it so that `e`
is wrapped in a special top-level `main` block (you should use
`(entry-symbol)`, as before). `e` may then call the functions being
defined, and its result is finally printed to the screen.

## IR Predicates and Interpreters

- **Predicates** (`irs.rkt`): Each pass has a precise predicate (e.g.,
  `anf-program?`, `c1-program?`, etc.). Tests check both input and
  output predicates at every step to catch malformed IR early. You
  should read and understand each predicate.

- **Interpreters** (`interpreters.rkt`): For many stages we run the
  interpreter over your IR to check semantic consistency—different IRs
  must compute the same result on the same input stream. The harness
  reports whether outputs match and whether stdout across passes is
  consistent. Please do not modify this file.

## How to Compile and Run

To directly compile a single file using `main.rkt`:

```
racket main.rkt test-programs/<prog>.scm
```

The compiler dumps a long summary of the work done at each pass, and
ultimately yields a program `./output` which it compiles using
system-specific infrastructure (works on Linux/Mac).

Example:

```
$ racket main.rkt test-programs/example.scm
Compiling IR (using *your* compile.rkt) …
'(pushq (reg rbp))
...
🏗️ Now building a binary... 🏗️
-> Host: macosx/x86_64  Target: x86_64-apple-darwin  Entry: main
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 -c ./output.s -o ./output.o
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 -c ./runtime.c -o ./runtime.o
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 ./output.o ./runtime.o -o ./output
Success! Executable produced at: ./output
Done!
$ ./output
42
```

Programs that `(read)` input will prompt or consume stdin. You can use
input redirection:  
`./output < input-files/1.in`

## Debugging Guide

This is a tricky project, and it is really important that you lean
into a debugging methodology that works for you. Let me share with you
some advice I used when I was writing the compiler myself.

- First, I started by writing a single manual test in the top-level of
  `compile.rkt`, so that I could easily just sit at the command line
  (or Dr. Racket) and run `compile.rkt` (with no command-line
  arguments) and see if the test would pass. At the early stages of
  debugging, this is an excellent strategy, since it means
  fully-pushbutton test. For example, I had (appended to
  `compile.rkt`) something like:

```
(displayln ;; or pretty-print 
 (dump-x86-64
  (prelude-and-conclusion
   (patch-instructions
    (assign-homes
     (select-instructions
      (uncover-locals
       (explicate-control
        (anf-convert
         (uniqueify
          (shrink
           (typecheck '(program (let ([a (read)])
                                  (let ([b (read)]) (if (or (> a b) (eq? (+ b 1) 0))
                                                        (+ a b)
                                                        (- b a)))))))))))))))))
```

- I started with a fairly large test in my case--since I was merely
  adding forms not present in my previous implementation. In this
  case, I would often be hitting match failures--this is a *good*
  thing, it allows me to trace down exactly where I need to add match
  cases and handle new behavior. Of course, the issue is that I also
  need to mix that with thinking holistically about the specs of each
  IR.

- After I thought I had each pass of the compiler working, I started
  switching over to `main.rkt`, which will run all passes of the
  compiler and will report their outputs. I also needed to write the
  interpreters (you do not), and so I debugged some of those using
  `main.rkt`.

- Last, once things are acutally working, I used `test.rkt`, which I
  adjusted to account for the possibility of expected type errors in
  malformed inputs.

- My advice to you is similar: start with something where you can
  press "Run" (or continually reinvoke `racket compile.rkt`). It will
  facilitate rapid testing, and it is really important to build some
  skill and intuition for how to accomplish that exercise.

- Remember, debugging is a key concept that you are practicing in this
  class. The worst possible thing you can do is "guess and check"
  debugging (running the tests and hoping they pass)--the issue is
  that doing this gives you very little observability into why the
  code is broken. To fix this, you need to have some way of
  interacting with the code. Experts debug their code using an
  iterative, hypothesis-driven methodology, where they (a) articulate
  a falsifiable hypothesis ("this match pattern never matches
  anything"), (b) change their code to observe the bug ("add a
  displayln at every match handler"), and (c) 

## Tricky Parts of this Project

**BE CAREFUL** of the following:

- In the event of a type error, raise `(error (type-error-tag) "Error here...")`

- In the previous implementation, we had only a single block, and
  `prelude-and-conclusion` sandwiched the generated code between code
  to set up the function and code to print the value and exit the
  function. In this case, that will not work so well. Instead, I
  recommend the following approach: in the `select-instructions` pass,
  assume the existence of a special block named `conclusion`, which
  assumes the return value (to be printed) is in `%rax`, and jump to
  that label. Then, in `prelude-and-conclusion`, add this label to the
  program with the right code to print the value of `%rax`. 

- On Mac OSX, you need to prefix labels for functions, meaning `_main`
  instead of `main`. To facilitate this, I provide a function `(rt-sym
  s)`, which converts a symbol to a system-specific variant (based on
  the OS). However, you only need to worry about this for labels that
  correspond to exported *function* entrypoints, not other labels that
  are internal to the program (e.g., the target of a jump, or even
  `conclusion`). This is important, because you don't want to call
  `(rt-sym ...)` until the *very last pass* (it is ugly to make the
  previous passes OSX/Linux-specific). The issue is this: if you
  naively rename every label from `foo` to `_foo`, then you also need
  to ensure that you clean up jumps so that instead of jumping to
  `foo`, they go to `_foo`. In my implementation, I handled this as
  follows: I simply used `(rt-sym ...)` on the `(entry-symbol)` (i.e.,
  `main`), which is the *only* function in this project.

- Ensure 16-byte stack alignment before `callq`

## Testing Infrastructure

The file `test.rkt` runs a set of formal tests, as in the last
project.

- `frontend` – runs `typecheck` → `anf-convert`, checks ANF via interpreter
- `middleend` – runs `explicate-control` → `uncover-locals`, checks via `interpret-c1`
- `backend` – runs `select-instructions` → `patch-instructions`, checks via `interpret-instr`
- `native` – full compile → build binary → run with stdin → compare stdout to golden

Usage:

```
racket test.rkt -m <mode> -i <comma-separated input files> -g <comma-separated goldens> <program.scm>
```

Example:

```
racket test.rkt -m native -i ./input-files/1.in -g goldens/example_1_uniqueify.stdout test-programs/example.scm
```

## Goldens: What They Are

We use goldens to verify correctness:

1. **Isolation goldens** – for non-native modes:
   - Compare serialized ASTs and interpreter stdout
2. **Native goldens** – for full pipeline:
   - Run your compiled binary, compare stdout

Layout:

- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.in-ast`
- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.out-ast`
- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.interp`
- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.stdout`

Instructor-only `gengoldens` mode regenerates these.

## FAQ

- **Do I need register allocation?**  
  No. Stack-based only.

- **Can I write helpers?**  
  Yes—keep pass signatures unchanged.

- **Can I call arbitrary C functions?**  
  No. Only use `read_int64` / `print_int64`.

- **How are inputs fed?**  
  Via stdin; `.in` files are whitespace-separated integers.

## Autograder Tests

The autograder invokes `test.rkt` in JSON mode. Your job is to make
each pass satisfy its predicates and produce semantically equivalent
IRs until final native code passes all tests.
