# Project 2: LIf / R2 → x86-64

This project is inspired by *Essentials of Compilation* (EoC), but the
code here is a from-scratch reimplementation with some simplifications
to keep the workload reasonable and to make grading/debugging
clearer. Where behavior differs from the book, **this README is the
source of truth** for expectations, file names, and command lines.

You will compile a tiny expression language (**R2 / LIf**) with
integers, booleans, `let`, arithmetic, conditionals, and comparisons
into x86-64 assembly, then produce a real binary and test it on actual
inputs. The power of this language is (roughly) decision diagrams (and
functions on) finite input streams. 

This README file contains some specific tips which I hope you will
read, including debugging tips and some project-specific
instructions. Please read the whole README file and be prepared to
discuss it in office hours, email, and class.

## Input Language (R2 / LIf)

R2 extends the straight-line arithmetic core with booleans and simple
conditionals. It includes integers, booleans, variables, `let`, unary
minus, addition, logical operators, comparisons, and a zero-argument
`(read)` primitive that consumes one integer from stdin at runtime.

Before shrinking, the surface language allows `and`, `or`, `not`,
`if`, and the comparators `eq?`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. The `shrink`
pass reduces this set to `eq?` and `<`, removes binary minus, and
desugars `and`/`or`.

```racket
;; Core (pre-shrink) expressions and programs (abridged)
(define (cmp? cmp) (member cmp '(eq? < <= > >=)))
(define (R2-exp? e)
  (match e
    [#t #t]
    [#f #t]
    [(? fixnum? n) #t]
    [`(read) #t]
    [`(- ,(? R2-exp? e)) #t]                           ; unary minus
    [`(+ ,(? R2-exp? e0) ,(? R2-exp? e1)) #t]
    [`(and ,(? R2-exp? e0) ,(? R2-exp? e1)) #t]
    [`(or  ,(? R2-exp? e0) ,(? R2-exp? e1)) #t]
    [`(not ,(? R2-exp? e)) #t]
    [`(,(? cmp? c) ,(? R2-exp? e0) ,(? R2-exp? e1)) #t]
    [`(if ,(? R2-exp? g) ,(? R2-exp? t) ,(? R2-exp? f)) #t]
    [(? symbol? var) #t]
    [`(let ([,(? symbol? x) ,(? R2-exp? e)]) ,(? R2-exp? e-body)) #t]
    [_ #f]))

(define (R2? e)
  (match e
    [`(program ,(? R2-exp? exp)) #t]
    [_ #f]))
```

Programs on disk are s-expressions, e.g.:

```racket
(program
  (let ([a (+ 1 (read))])
    (if (<= a 0)
        (let ([x (if (< a 2) 3 (+ 1 (- 2)))])
          (> x 1))
        3)))
```

## Repository Layout

- `compile.rkt` – Your pass implementations. You will edit functions provided here.
  -> This is the *only* file you will edit! The rest are read-only
- `irs.rkt` – IR definitions and predicates like `anf-program?`, `c1-program?`, etc. (see also typed/shrunk variants)
- `interpreters.rkt` – Reference interpreters for several IRs (used by tests and for your own debugging).
- `system.rkt` – System/ABI configuration, pass names, runtime filenames, output paths, etc.
- `main.rkt` – Driver that runs all passes, can build a binary, and can launch a debug server.
- `test.rkt` – Test harness. Runs isolation tests or end-to-end native tests depending on `-m` mode.
- `runtime.c` – Minimal runtime (`read_int64`, `print_int64`, etc.).
- `test-programs/` – Example programs (`.scm`).
- `input-files/` – Input streams for programs (lines of integers).
- `goldens/` – Instructor goldens (IR snapshots, interpreter outputs, and stdout baselines).

Please do not rename files or directories (grading infra depends on them).

## The Compiler Pipeline (passes)

The compiler consists of a number of passes. Please do not get
overwhelmed: each of these passes is going to be very small, and each
has a specific, isolated behavior that will allow us to explain the
specific stages of compilation. Additionally, as the code is compiled,
it is translated into an increasingly-lower-level IR.

You will implement the following passes:

1. `typecheck` → assign R2 types (`Int`, `Bool`) or raise `'type-error`
   Input: `R2?` → Output: `R2?` → Interp: `interpret-R2`
2. `shrink` → remove binary `-`, `and`/`or`, and `<=, >, >=` (desugar to `eq?`/`<`)  
   Input: `R2?` → Output: `shrunk-R2?` → Interp: `interpret-R2`
3. `uniqueify` → ensure each bound identifier is written exactly once  
   Input: `shrunk-R2?` → Output: `unique-source-tree?` → Interp: `interpret-R2`
4. `anf-convert` → ANF conversion (introduce temps; maintain booleans/comparisons)  
   Input: `unique-source-tree?` → Output: `anf-program?` → Interp: `interpret-anf`
5. `explicate-control` → ANF → **C1** (blocks with `(seq (assign …) …)`, `if`/`goto`)  
   Input: `anf-program?` → Output: `c1-program?` → Interp: `interpret-c1`
6. `uncover-locals` → collect locals for stack layout  
   Input: `c1-program?` → Output: `locals-program?` → Interp: `interpret-c1`
7. `select-instructions` → C1 → pseudo-x86 (vars, `cmpq`, `set e|l`, `jmp-if e|l`)  
   Input: `locals-program?` → Output: `instr-program?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
8. `assign-homes` → map `(var x)` → `(deref (reg rbp) n)`  
   Input: `instr-program?` → Output: `homes-assigned-program?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
9. `patch-instructions` → fix illegal memory↔memory moves and related cases  
   Input: `homes-assigned-program?` → Output: `patched-program?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
10. `prelude-and-conclusion` → prologue, print result, return 0  
    Input: `patched-program?` → Output: `x86-64?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
11. `dump-x86-64` → render assembly text  
    Input: `x86-64?` → Output: `string?` → Interp: `dummy-interp-x86-64`

**What you implement**: All passes in `compile.rkt` are scaffolded.
Your job is to produce outputs that satisfy each predicate in
`irs.rkt` and that remain semantically equivalent (the interpreters
check this).

## IR Predicates and Interpreters

- **Predicates** (`irs.rkt`): Each pass has a precise predicate (e.g.,
  `anf-program?`, `c1-program?`, etc.). Tests check both input and
  output predicates at every step to catch malformed IR early. You
  should read and understand each predicate.

- **Interpreters** (`interpreters.rkt`): For many stages we run the
  interpreter over your IR to check semantic consistency—different IRs
  must compute the same result on the same input stream. The harness
  reports whether outputs match and whether stdout across passes is
  consistent. Please do not modify this file.

## How to Compile and Run

To directly compile a single file using `main.rkt`:

```
racket main.rkt test-programs/<prog>.scm
```

The compiler dumps a long summary of the work done at each pass, and
ultimately yields a program `./output` which it compiles using
system-specific infrastructure (works on Linux/Mac).

Example:

```
$ racket main.rkt test-programs/example.scm
Compiling IR (using *your* compile.rkt) …
'(pushq (reg rbp))
...
🏗️ Now building a binary... 🏗️
-> Host: macosx/x86_64  Target: x86_64-apple-darwin  Entry: main
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 -c ./output.s -o ./output.o
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 -c ./runtime.c -o ./runtime.o
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 ./output.o ./runtime.o -o ./output
Success! Executable produced at: ./output
Done!
$ ./output

```

Programs that `(read)` input will prompt or consume stdin. You can use
input redirection:  
`./output < input-files/1.in`

## Debugging Guide

This is a tricky project, and it is really important that you lean
into a debugging methodology that works for you. Let me share with you
some advice I used when I was writing the compiler myself.

- First, I started by writing a single manual test in the top-level of
  `compile.rkt`, so that I could easily just sit at the command line
  (or Dr. Racket) and run `compile.rkt` (with no command-line
  arguments) and see if the test would pass. At the early stages of
  debugging, this is an excellent strategy, since it means
  fully-pushbutton test. For example, I had (appended to
  `compile.rkt`) something like:

```
(displayln ;; or pretty-print 
 (dump-x86-64
  (prelude-and-conclusion
   (patch-instructions
    (assign-homes
     (select-instructions
      (uncover-locals
       (explicate-control
        (anf-convert
         (uniqueify
          (shrink
           (typecheck '(program (let ([a (read)])
                                  (let ([b (read)]) (if (or (> a b) (eq? (+ b 1) 0))
                                                        (+ a b)
                                                        (- b a)))))))))))))))))
```

- I started with a fairly large test in my case--since I was merely
  adding forms not present in my previous implementation. In this
  case, I would often be hitting match failures--this is a *good*
  thing, it allows me to trace down exactly where I need to add match
  cases and handle new behavior. Of course, the issue is that I also
  need to mix that with thinking holistically about the specs of each
  IR.

- After I thought I had each pass of the compiler working, I started
  switching over to `main.rkt`, which will run all passes of the
  compiler and will report their outputs. I also needed to write the
  interpreters (you do not), and so I debugged some of those using
  `main.rkt`.

- Last, once things are acutally working, I used `test.rkt`, which I
  adjusted to account for the possibility of expected type errors in
  malformed inputs.

- My advice to you is similar: start with something where you can
  press "Run" (or continually reinvoke `racket compile.rkt`). It will
  facilitate rapid testing, and it is really important to build some
  skill and intuition for how to accomplish that exercise.

- Remember, debugging is a key concept that you are practicing in this
  class.

## Tricky Parts of this Project

**BE CAREFUL** of the following:

- In the event of a type error, raise `(error (type-error-tag) "Error here...")`

- In the previous implementation, we had only a single block, and
  `prelude-and-conclusion` sandwiched the generated code between code
  to set up the function and code to print the value and exit the
  function. In this case, that will not work so well. Instead, I
  recommend the following approach: in the `select-instructions` pass,
  assume the existence of a special block named `conclusion`, which
  assumes the return value (to be printed) is in `%rax`, and jump to
  that label. Then, in `prelude-and-conclusion`, add this label to the
  program with the right code to print the value of `%rax`. 

- On Mac OSX, you need to prefix labels for functions, meaning `_main`
  instead of `main`. To facilitate this, I provide a function `(rt-sym
  s)`, which converts a symbol to a system-specific variant (based on
  the OS). However, you only need to worry about this for labels that
  correspond to exported *function* entrypoints, not other labels that
  are internal to the program (e.g., the target of a jump, or even
  `conclusion`). This is important, because you don't want to call
  `(rt-sym ...)` until the *very last pass* (it is ugly to make the
  previous passes OSX/Linux-specific). The issue is this: if you
  naively rename every label from `foo` to `_foo`, then you also need
  to ensure that you clean up jumps so that instead of jumping to
  `foo`, they go to `_foo`. In my implementation, I handled this as
  follows: I simply used `(rt-sym ...)` on the `(entry-symbol)` (i.e.,
  `main`), which is the *only* function in this project.

- Ensure 16-byte stack alignment before `callq`

## Testing Infrastructure

The file `test.rkt` runs a set of formal tests, as in the last
project.

- `frontend` – runs `typecheck` → `anf-convert`, checks ANF via interpreter
- `middleend` – runs `explicate-control` → `uncover-locals`, checks via `interpret-c1`
- `backend` – runs `select-instructions` → `patch-instructions`, checks via `interpret-instr`
- `native` – full compile → build binary → run with stdin → compare stdout to golden

Usage:

```
racket test.rkt -m <mode> -i <comma-separated input files> -g <comma-separated goldens> <program.scm>
```

Example:

```
racket test.rkt -m native -i ./input-files/1.in -g goldens/example_1_uniqueify.stdout test-programs/example.scm
```

## Goldens: What They Are

We use goldens to verify correctness:

1. **Isolation goldens** – for non-native modes:
   - Compare serialized ASTs and interpreter stdout
2. **Native goldens** – for full pipeline:
   - Run your compiled binary, compare stdout

Layout:

- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.in-ast`
- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.out-ast`
- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.interp`
- `goldens/<prog>_<n>_<pass>.stdout`

Instructor-only `gengoldens` mode regenerates these.

## FAQ

- **Do I need register allocation?**  
  No. Stack-based only.

- **Can I write helpers?**  
  Yes—keep pass signatures unchanged.

- **Can I call arbitrary C functions?**  
  No. Only use `read_int64` / `print_int64`.

- **How are inputs fed?**  
  Via stdin; `.in` files are whitespace-separated integers.

## Autograder Tests

The autograder invokes `test.rkt` in JSON mode. Your job is to make
each pass satisfy its predicates and produce semantically equivalent
IRs until final native code passes all tests.
