# Project 2: LVar → x86-64

This project is inspired by *Essentials of Compilation* (EoC), but the
code here is a from-scratch reimplementation with some simplifications
to keep the workload reasonable and to make grading/debugging
clearer. Where behavior differs from the book, **this README is the
source of truth** for expectations, file names, and command lines.

You will compile a tiny expression language (R1) for straight-line
arithmetic with `let`-bindings and `read` into x86-64 assembly, then
produce a real binary and test it on actual inputs. Essentially,
programs in our language are sequences of reads, ultimately printing
one final output.

## Input Language (R1 / LVar)

R1 (covered in the book, chapter 2) is a straight-line expression
language with integers, variables, `let`, unary minus, addition, and a
zero-argument `(read)` primitive that consumes one integer from stdin
at runtime.

    ;; Expressions (exp) and programs
    (define (R1-exp? e)
      (match e
        [(? fixnum? n) #t]
        [`(read) #t]
        [`(- ,(? R1-exp? e)) #t]
        [`(+ ,(? R1-exp? e0) ,(? R1-exp? e1)) #t]
        [(? symbol? var) #t]
        [`(let ([,(? symbol? x) ,(? R1-exp? e)]) ,(? R1-exp? e-body)) #t]
        [_ #f]))

    (define (R1? e)
      (match e
        [`(program ,(? R1-exp? exp)) #t]
        [_ #f]))

Programs on disk are s-expressions, e.g.:

    (program
      (let ([x (read)])
        (let ([y (+ x 10)])
          (+ y (- y)))))

## Repository Layout

- `compile.rkt` – TODO - Your pass implementations. You will edit functions provided here.
  -> This is the *only* file you will edit! The rest are read-only
- `irs.rkt` – IR definitions and predicates like `anf-program?`, `c0-program?`, etc.
- `interpreters.rkt` – Reference interpreters for several IRs (used by tests and for your own debugging).
- `system.rkt` – System/ABI configuration, pass names, runtime filenames, output paths, etc.
- `main.rkt` – Driver that runs all passes, can build a binary, and can launch a debug server.
- `test.rkt` – Test harness. Runs isolation tests or end-to-end native tests depending on `-m` mode.
- `runtime.c` – Minimal runtime (`read_int64`, `print_int64`, etc.).
- `test-programs/` – Example programs (`.scm`).
- `input-files/` – Input streams for programs (lines of integers).
- `goldens/` – Instructor goldens (IR snapshots, interpreter outputs, and stdout baselines).

Please do not rename files or directories (grading infra depends on them).

## The Compiler Pipeline (passes)

The compiler consists of a number of passes. Please do not get
overwhelmed: each of these passes is going to be very small, and each
have a specific, isolated behavior that will allow us to explain the
specific stages of compilation. Additionally, as the code is compiled,
it is translated into an increasinglly-lower-level IR.

You will implement the following passes:

1. `uniqueify` → ensures every bound identifier is unique  
   Input: `R1?` → Output: `unique-source-tree?` → Interp: `interpret-R1`
2. `anf-convert` → ANF conversion (introduce temps to flatten nested ops)  
   Input: `unique-source-tree?` → Output: `anf-program?` → Interp: `interpret-anf`
3. `explicate-control` → convert ANF to C0 (a statement/block flavor)  
   Input: `anf-program?` → Output: `c0-program?` → Interp: `interpret-c0`
4. `uncover-locals` → collect local variables (stack frame sizing later)  
   Input: `c0-program?` → Output: `locals-program?` → Interp: `interpret-c0`
5. `select-instructions` → map C0 statements to pseudo-x86 instructions over vars  
   Input: `locals-program?` → Output: `instr-program?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
6. `assign-homes` → assign each var to a stack slot `(deref (reg rbp) offset)`  
   Input: `instr-program?` → Output: `homes-assigned-program?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
7. `patch-instructions` → break illegal memory→memory `movq` into two moves via `%rax`  
   Input: `homes-assigned-program?` → Output: `patched-program?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
8. `prelude-and-conclusion` → function prologue/epilogue; call `print_int64` on `%rax`  
   Input: `patched-program?` → Output: `x86-64?` → Interp: `interpret-instr`
9. `dump-x86-64` → render to assembler text (string)  
   Input: `x86-64?` → Output: `string?` → Interp: `dummy-interp-x86-64` (skips interpretation)

**What you implement**: All passes in `compile.rkt` are
scaffolded. Your job is to produce outputs that satisfy each predicate
in `irs.rkt` and that remain semantically equivalent (the interpreters
check this).

## IR Predicates and Interpreters

- Predicates (`irs.rkt`): Each pass has a precise predicate (e.g.,
  `anf-program?`, `c0-program?`, etc.). Tests check both input and
  output predicates at every step to catch malformed IR early. You
  should read and understand each predicate.

- Interpreters (`interpreters.rkt`): For many stages we run the
  interpreter over your IR to check semantic consistency—different IRs
  must compute the same result on the same input stream. The harness
  reports whether outputs match and whether stdout across passes is
  consistent. Please do not modify this file.

## How to Compile and Run

To directly compile a single file using `main.rkt`:

    racket main.rkt test-programs/<prog>.scm

The compiler dumps a long summary of the work done at each pass, and
ultimately yielding a program `./output` which it compiles using
system-specific infrastructure (this should work on Linux/Mac--ping me
if any issues). For example, I can see:

```
kkmicins@lcs-QVR7XH2QGR p1 % racket main.rkt test-programs/r0-0.scm
Compiling IR (using *your* compile.rkt) …
'(pushq (reg rbp))
...
🏗️ Now building a binary... 🏗️
-> Host: macosx/x86_64  Target: x86_64-apple-darwin  Entry: main
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 -c ./output.s -o ./output.o
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 -c ./runtime.c -o ./runtime.o
/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin -Wall -O2 ./output.o ./runtime.o -o ./output
Success! Executable produced at: ./output
Done!
kkmicins@lcs-QVR7XH2QGR p1 % ./output
42
```

Here, I invoked `main.rkt` and passed it a single file, one of the
files in `test-programs`. This is by far the easiest way to *begin*
your work on this project. My advice to you is to start with the
simplest programs in `test-programs`, get them to compile, and then
move on to larger programs.

For programs that `(read)` input, they will emit programs which
require you to type inputs into the console. For example, `(print
(read) + (read))` will compile to a program which calls `read_int64`
(from runtime.c) twice. You can either manually type in inputs, or you
can use redirection (e.g., `output <input-files/1.in`) to input them
from a file.

## Common Tricky Systems Issues

Systems-specific code is in `system.rkt`, which you should (hopefully)
have to use minimally, as my starter files give a good amount of help
here.

- **IMPORTANT**: ensure 16-byte stack alignment _before_ calls (System
  V / macOS both require it).
- **IMPORTANT**: To ensure your code is portable across Linux/Mach
  ABIs, our intermediate IRs work with "symbols" rather than labels,
  and (during the last pass, `dump-x86`) we specialize labels to
  Mach/Linux. To do this, you should use the helper function `(rt-sym
  symbol)` which produces "_symbol" on Mac and "symbol" as required by
  the ABI.
- Output assembly: `./output.s`
- Objects: `./output.o` and `./runtime.o`
- Binary: `./a.out`
- Assembler/Linker: Clang by default. Override with `CC=/path/to/clang` if needed.
- Runtime linkage: `runtime.c` is compiled and linked in. The renderer emits externs for runtime symbols.
- Linux linking uses `-no-pie` for simple non-PIE linking.

## Debug server

There is a debug server, which (if you can get it to work) offers the
ability to interactively visualize the output of each pass of the
requisite input in your language.

    racket debug-server.rkt

You can either type programs, or you can (hopefully) select from a set
of programs. 

## Testing infrastructure

`test.rkt` is the primary entrypoint during development. Modes:

- `frontend` – runs `uniqueify` → `anf-convert` and checks ANF via interpreter
- `middleend` – runs `explicate-control` → `uncover-locals` and checks via `interpret-c0`
- `backend` – runs `select-instructions` → `patch-instructions` and checks via `interpret-instr`
- `native` – full compile to assembly, build the binary, run it with real stdin; compare stdout to goldens

Usage:

    racket test.rkt -m <mode> -i <comma-separated input files> -g <comma-separated goldens> <program.scm>

- `<program.scm>` is a file in `test-programs/`
- `-i` paths are usually in `./input-files/`
- `-g` paths point into `./goldens/`

Examples:

    racket test.rkt -m middleend -i ./input-files/1.in \
      -g goldens/r0-0_1_uniqueify.stdout,goldens/r0-0_1_explicate-control.in-ast \
      test-programs/r0-0_1.scm

    racket test.rkt -m backend -i ./input-files/1.in \
      -g goldens/r0-0_1_uniqueify.stdout,goldens/r0-0_1_select-instructions.in-ast \
      test-programs/r0-0_1.scm

    racket test.rkt -m native -i ./input-files/1.in \
      -g goldens/r0-0_1_uniqueify.stdout \
      test-programs/r0-0_1.scm

## Goldens: what they are and how we use them

We use goldens in several ways:

1) Isolation goldens (IR & stdout):
   - For non-native modes, we compare:
     - Your pass output (serialized) to an instructor-provided `.in-ast` file
     - The interpreter’s stdout to a `*.stdout` file

2) Native goldens (end-to-end):
   - We run your produced binary and compare its stdout to a golden stdout file

How goldens are organized:

- `goldens/<progname>_<input#>_<passname>.in-ast` – serialized input to that pass
- `goldens/<progname>_<input#>_<passname>.out-ast` – serialized output of that pass
- `goldens/<progname>_<input#>_<passname>.interp` – interpreter result snapshot
- `goldens/<progname>_<input#>_<passname>.stdout` – stdout (what we actually check)

The instructor has a `gengoldens` mode to regenerate these. Students do not need it.

## Common Errors & Fixes

- “Satisfies output predicate: no”
  - Your pass constructed malformed IR. Re-read the corresponding
    `…-program?` predicate in `irs.rkt`. Print your term and compare
    shapes.

- Interpreter mismatch or inconsistent stdout across passes
  - You are changing the behavior of the code in compiling it. Debug
    by narrowing the pass window. Compare interpreter outputs before
    and after each pass to locate the offensive one.

- Illegal memory→memory `movq`
  - `patch-instructions` must rewrite `(movq (deref …) (deref …))`
    into two moves via `%rax`.

- Stack alignment or frame size wrong
  - `prelude-and-conclusion` relies on correct locals and
    offsets. Ensure `uncover-locals` and `assign-homes` agree.

- Executable missing after “building a binary…”
  - Toolchain failed. Check clang/ld messages. On Linux ensure clang
    is installed (or set `CC`).

- Mach-O underscores vs ELF
  - Do not hardcode `_`. Always go through `rt-sym` and
    `runtime-function-externs`.

- Native test says no executable present
  - You ran `-m native` without a successful build. Ensure the final
    pass emits assembly and the assembler/linker stage succeeds.


## FAQ

- Do I need register allocation?
  - Not in P1. We mostly compute into `%rax`, store into vars, then place vars on the stack.

- Can I write helper functions?
  - Yes, as long as pass interfaces/types remain as specified by the predicates.

- Can I emit calls to other C library functions?
  - Not in P1. Use the provided runtime functions (`read_int64`, `print_int64`).

- Why underscores on macOS?
  - Mach-O prefixes symbols. `rt-sym` abstracts this. Don’t add `_` yourself.

- How are inputs fed to my program?
  - For native tests, the harness writes the whitespace-separated
    numbers from the `.in` file to your program’s stdin. Your stdout
    must match the golden.

## Autograder Tests

The autograder tests can be run using `tester.py`.
